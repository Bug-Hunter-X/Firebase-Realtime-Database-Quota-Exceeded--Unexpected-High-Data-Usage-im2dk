# Firebase Realtime Database Quota Exceeded: Unexpected High Data Usage

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often difficult-to-debug, issue in Firebase Realtime Database: exceeding quota limits due to inefficient data structure or query design.  Even with seemingly low data volume, improperly structured queries or data can dramatically increase read/write operations, triggering the `FirebaseError: Quota exceeded` error.

The `unexpectedQuota.js` file shows example code that causes the unexpected quota issue.  `optimizedQuota.js` demonstrates how to optimize the database structure and queries to avoid this problem.

**Key issues addressed:**
* Inefficient data traversal in queries.
* Data structure causing excess node reads.
* Unnecessary data fetching.

**Solutions:**
* Optimize database structure for efficient data retrieval.
* Use more targeted queries to fetch only the required data.
* Properly handle asynchronous operations to avoid concurrent data requests.
