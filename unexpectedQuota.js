The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `FirebaseError: Quota exceeded` error even when the project's usage is far below the free tier limits.  This is often due to a subtle issue with data structure or inefficient queries that lead to unexpected data traversal, resulting in exceeding the read or write operations allowed within a given time frame. For example, deeply nested data or complex queries that traverse large portions of the database can trigger this error.
